# What am i currently working on?

here's a small list of my projects on github, feel free to click on any of them and visit the GitHub page. 

- Nasa Image Downloader \
This is a simple python script that allows to download locally and quickly image metadata from the huge database at @ and compile it in a .pkl file for easy lookup. After building the initial database one can choose to search for images in a specific timeframe and from a specific mission done by nasa to actually download the images. All of this is primarily done to compile timelapses of orbits around earth and to find new desktop wallpapers. \

- Spoodl \
I recently started learning the basics of using a consolle with a couple of friends, and to mix songs in one's software of choice it is needed to have the actual .mp3 files in storage. Spoodl is a script that has the task of syncronizing a local folder of .mp3 files to a bunch of playlists on spotify, downloading missing tracks, deleting removed ones, renaming and sorting new files once downloaded. \

- Nexus \
We live in a day and age in witch the number of times one has to perform a digital task such as sending emails, checking the weather etc. in one day is pretty consistently high. Digital assistants such as alexa, siri and similar have mostly been a letdown both in terms of actual usefulness and in terms of privacy and security. Nexus is an open-source project aimed at building the basic infrastructure for a cluster of microservices that are able to recive task from a user, perform said task and return an appropriate response. Neural networks are both used to correctly classify the task to perform and to generate human readable responses to give back to the user. The actual task Nexus is able to perform is defined by the users, and is designed to be modular and easy to access so that new task and capabilities can be slowly added over time. \

- Particle Simulation \
This program is the result of a course in physics-based simulation i took, it's main pourpose is to simulate and analyze the behaviour of a number of repulsive particles confined in a hexagonal lattice with continuity boundaries conditions and variable size. \

- Drone Game \
Drone game is a temporary name i've given to this small side-project i started in unity to make a simple rougelike and space-themed videogame, taking heavy inspiration from FTL and Duskers. \
