Heyo! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an enthusiastic explorer of all things tech. From coding to 3d modeling, from game engines to diy projects with microcontrollers, if a computer can do it i probably want to learn about it.

I have a deep passion for science and a small background in physics, i love to learn how the world around us works and how to apply this knowledge to solve practical problems. 

# What am i good at

Both during my years at university and in my free time i had the time to learn and teach myself many different things, following my interests and often falling inside deep rabbit holes on topics i previously never even heard of.

- `Programming`

    - I first started getting into programming back when i was 15 or so and during theese years i've played around with many languages such as C++, C# and a bit of java but i have the most experience with Rust And python. I used theese languages both for personal projects and courses at university, learning a lot while solving everyday problems with this new skill.
    - Machine learning is a field i've been captivated by from the moment i first discovered it. The whole concept of replicating digitally how our brain works is still incredible to me, but after learning the basics of how theese systems work it's possible to leverage the immense power that AI offers. I've worked a bit with different models and architectures, from transformer-based LLMs to diffusion-based image generators, taking advantage of the playground offered by google at [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and trying to run some of theese models locally on my machine.
    - Linux is a powerful environment to develop software, in order to write code i've learned my way around interacting with the OS via command line and how to troubleshoot (let's be honest) frequent problems, but after some initial struggling i became more familiar with it, to the point of becoming my daily-driver os in my laptop.
    - I managed for many years a personal arch-based server, and i learned a bit about system management, remote infrstructure and service management tools like Docker, toghether with the basics of system security, cryptography and privacy on a system-level.

- `Software & Tools`

    Through my experiences and projects, i've learned that often the best way to solve a problem is not bashing your head againt it until it is solved, but instead knowing the right tools to achieve the wanted result without reinventing the wheel everytime or wasting time. Because of this i've learned many tools and frameworks that helped me with my projects in the past.

    - `Blender` - 3D modeling, rendering, vfx compositing, functional prototyping \
    here's a small render i made

    - `Unity 3D` - Videogame production, physics simulator \

    - `Adobe Premiere` - Video editing
    - `Arduino IDE` - Arduino board programming platform
    - `Root` - Data analysis and graphing tool developed by [CERN](https://root.cern/)

    - `Frameworks` - Various frameworks i worked with
        - Transformers, matplotlib, pyrogram, fastapi, pandas, hugo, rasa, regex, latex, docker, arduino, numpy, wireshark.

- `DIY and prototyping`

    I always liked bringing to the real world ideas and projects i had in my mind so i've learned many practical skills to achieve this goal.
    From the basics of electronic circuitry to play around with arduino's to the correct way to operate big and dangerous powertools, just as much as in the digital space, knowing the right tool to use for any given task is half of the job.
    
# What do i like

Here's a small list of my biggest interests

- `Software` \
I have always been fascinated by computers, understanding how they work and how i can control them is still today one of my favourite activities. 
- `Space Technologies` \
Space is still the ultimate frontier for humanity, to be able to reach and stay among the stars we have to come up with the most advanced tech and unorthodox solutions, pushing humanity to their limit. 
- `Machine Learning` \
This is a field that recently gained a lot of popularity, and i stronly believe that used in the correct way and for the right problems machine learning could be an invaluable asset in the near future.
- `Music` \
I always loved music, and i recently started trying my hand with a consolle and MIXX. I dont think i could spend an entire day of my life without listening to some music if you asked me to.
- `World Politics` \
We live in a chaotic world, governed by interest, kindness and greed. To make sense of our (admittedly not so good) current situation we have to look around us and behind in time.
- `Physics` \
I have a background in Physics at univerity and im still incredibly fascinated by it, knowing how the fundamental laws and forces of our universe govern it's development, how the stars and the planets behave how they do, how black holes work instills in me awe and curiosity to this day.
- `Green Energy` \
Climate change is probably the biggest challenge our generation will face, we have the power and the mission to transition to cleaner fuels and to help this transition in any way possible.
- `DIY` \
Coding software is fun, but you know what's better? Seeing code you wrote influence stuff in the real world. Getting my hands dirty and building stuff by myself has to be one of my favourite activities, from building stuff i need myself, to repairing devices i own to fight consumerims.

# What do i believe in

- I am a `environmentalist`, i believe that nature should be preserved and protected in any feasible way, and that it is a critical step we have to take as a species to ensure our continued survival. This being said, i also strongly believe that we have the tech, the knowledge and the power to collectively work towards a greener future, climate change is just a very complex problem that takes some out-of-the-box thinking to solve, but we're up for the challenge.

- Technology is advancing incredibly fast in a million different and fascinating fields, it's going to bring about a wealth of possibilities but there also will be some risks, for this reason it is important to engage in discussions on new and sometimes unconfortable topics like AI to evaluate benefits and risks in advance, theese thing are arriving wether we like it or not, the least we can do is to be as prepared as possible, and `the best way to be prepared is understanding how theese technologies work`.

- `Privacy is invaluable` and especially online i feel like we should be a bit more concious of where our personal data goes and gets sold for profit. I'm not saying that that data could potentially serve very nefarious pourposes in the future, i'm just saying that it'd be best for it to not exist in the first place.

- The world is an incredibly complex machine of cause and effect, to properly understand the situation, culture and economy we live in it's essential to look at what is happening around us. `Keeping up to date on current world events and politics is incredibly fascinating` to me and knowing the context, culture and history of a region or state is crucial to properly understand what is going on there currently.
